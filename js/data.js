    about: [
        `I am a passionate software engineer with a knack for solving ` +
        `complex problems and crafting creative solutions. With a ` +
        `Masters degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, ` +
        `I have built a strong foundation in software engineering, ` +
        `cloud computing, and automation. My career spans ` +
        `industry-leading companies like AWS and ARM, where I have ` +
        `worked on high-impact projects in cloud infrastructure, ` +
        `performance optimization, and CI/CD automation.`,

        `At AWS, I gained hands-on experience working on scalable, ` +
        `distributed systems and troubleshooting intricate cloud ` +
        `infrastructure challenges. Now, at ARM, I focus on ` +
        `optimizing cloud architectures, automating workflows, and ` +
        `enhancing system performance to push the limits of efficiency.`,

        `I have deep expertise in AWS, Python, Java, and Groovy, which ` +
        `I leverage to streamline CI/CD pipelines, enhance automation ` +
        `frameworks, and improve cloud performance. Whether it’s ` +
        `designing AI-powered solutions, automating large-scale ` +
        `infrastructure, or debugging mission-critical systems, I ` +
        `thrive on tackling difficult puzzles that push the boundaries ` +
        `of technology.`
