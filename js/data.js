        "I’m someone who’s curious, creative, and always learning or exploring something new. With a passion for optimizing things, I’m always down to learn and try new things. This space is where I share a bit of what I do, what I have done, what I'm working on, and things that inspire me. Feel free to poke around!",

        "I’m just a person trying to make sense of the world through engineering: by building, experimenting, and occasionally breaking things (on purpose or by accident, depends on the day). This site is a mix of experiments, projects, and thoughts. I enjoy taking on projects, solving problems, and picking up new things all while i figure out how stuff works. I the kind of guy who would figure things out as we go about the project. ",

        "I believe engineering is a means to an end. My goal is the end. So I guess, whatever it takes to get the job done. I also believe in hard work and always caughing up with technology with ever-ongoing learning to get there.",

        "I love tackling challenges, whether it’s with code, machines, or with duct tape. I mess around with ideas, trying to turn them into reality. Chasing projects that start with “what if…” that somehow turn into projects that keep me up at 2am. I built this site to document my journey, share things about me, and maybe connect with folks who get excited about the same stuff.",
